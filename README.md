 🩺 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a **Disease Prediction System** built in **Google Colab** that uses machine learning models to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.  

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessing of symptom-based dataset  
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.)  
- Interactive prediction of diseases based on input symptoms  
- Performance analysis using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Deployed and tested in Google Colab
